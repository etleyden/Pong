# About this project

My name is Ethan Leyden, and I am a Computer Science student at Virginia Commonwealth University. 
I have long been a self-taught hobbyist programmer, starting out with web development and design with HTML & CSS, and eventually building a lot of 2D games utilizing JS and 
HTML5 Canvas. I eventually started working on a lot of personal projects,
which showcased fundamental software engineering and design skills. Unfortunately, many of these projects were lost. 

As I have been rebuilding my online portfolio, one of the things I missed the most was the development process on those simple 2D games. This recreation of Atari's Pong 
is my first foray into that same world. Moving forward, I'm hoping to build more projects like these. 


### What could be improved about this project?

1. There are a lot of small details about the original game that haven't been included. If I were to invest more time into this project, I would go back and add those in.
2. There are some minor bugs that need to be fixed (like when you hit the ball with the side of your paddle)
3. I would refactor the code to be more reusable, and more modular. A lot of the sloppiness was largely due to my impatience and excitement to having a finished project. I plan to reuse quite a decent amount of this on some future projects. 
4. I would add some major common-sense features like adapting to window resizing, and an AI so someone could play this alone.
